The response plan includes steps for initiating the response plan, escalation, information gathering, engaging external resources, investigation, analysis, mitigation, restoration, notifications if necessary, and post-mortem.
 
Danfe Corp takes all reports of security-related issues very seriously, In the course of running the Danfe Corp service, we have used this response plan in the past, such as when a user contacts Danfe Corp support with a specific concern about the security of their account. Those investigations largely found end-user actions leading to an undesired situation (e.g. disgruntled employees, use of personal accounts for work, etc). Danfe Corp uses every incident to refine our response process and improve our overall security posture and to adapt to a changing threat landscape.
 
Danfe Corp monitors and quantifies the types, volumes, and impacts of incidents/findings related to security as part of our information security program. Also, they are reviewed during monthly security meetings."
