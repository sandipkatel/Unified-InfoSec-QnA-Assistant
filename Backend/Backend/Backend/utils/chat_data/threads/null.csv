Danfe Corp takes all reports of security-related issues very seriously, In the course of running the Danfe Corp service, we have used this response plan in the past, such as when a user contacts Danfe Corp support with a specific concern about the security of their account. Those investigations largely found end-user actions leading to an undesired situation (e.g. disgruntled employees, use of personal accounts for work, etc). Danfe Corp uses every incident to refine our response process and improve our overall security posture and to adapt to a changing threat landscape.
 
Danfe Corp monitors and quantifies the types, volumes, and impacts of incidents/findings related to security as part of our information security program. Also, they are reviewed during monthly security meetings."

It appears that the question about monitoring CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) notifications is not directly related to the provided context on Monitoring and Alerting, specifically Continuous Monitoring.

However, considering the broader scope of security operations and compliance, I will provide a refined response within the given context:

There doesn't seem to be an explicit mention of monitoring CERT notifications in the provided context. However, it's likely that a security operations function would include monitoring for such notifications as part of their overall continuous monitoring efforts.

In general, security teams should have processes in place to monitor and respond to alerts from various sources, including CERT notifications, which may involve:

1. Implementing automated tools to collect and analyze CERT notification data.
2. Establishing a process for timely review and response to such notifications.
3. Integrating with other monitoring systems to ensure comprehensive threat detection.
