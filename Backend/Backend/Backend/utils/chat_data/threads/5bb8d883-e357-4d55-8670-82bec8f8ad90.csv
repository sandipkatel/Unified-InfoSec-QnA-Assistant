2025-05-02T14:23:46.796607,system,"The provided context does not mention the frequency of risk assessments. However, it does state that vulnerability scans are conducted ""periodically"" to identify outdated software and misconfigurations.

There is no specific information on when the risk assessments are performed, only that they are conducted. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether risk assessments are performed at least annually.. "

2025-05-02T14:25:09.089856,user,Do you have a security operations team or personnel to establish log monitoring and incident response triage if an event occurs?
2025-05-02T14:25:09.089856,system,"It appears that the context provided does not explicitly mention a security operations team or personnel. However, it does mention the ""designated IRT"" (Incident Response Team) as the point of contact for reporting suspected security incidents.

In this case, I would refine my response to say:

While the context does not specifically mention a security operations team, it does emphasize the importance of having an Incident Response Team (IRT) in place to handle suspected security incidents. The IRT is responsible for notifying relevant stakeholders and taking actions to mitigate any potential threats. Therefore, it can be inferred that some form of incident response team or personnel is necessary to establish log monitoring and incident response triage processes.. "
