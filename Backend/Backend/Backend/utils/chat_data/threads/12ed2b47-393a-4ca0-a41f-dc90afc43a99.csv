Please describe.', 'text': 'The organization uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to protect controlled network access to IT resources. MFA ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive systems, while RBAC restricts user access based on their assigned roles within the organization.\n\n The organization utilizes a risk-based approach to its dynamic access management techniques, which include the use of identity and access management (IAM) tools and systems to protect information throughout its life cycle. These IAM systems monitor user behavior and activities in real-time, granting or revoking access based on predefined policies and controls. This proactive approach helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures that sensitive data remains secure across all stages of its lifecycle, from creation to disposal.'}"
