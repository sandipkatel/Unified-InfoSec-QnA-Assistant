Is the system a ""Cloud Service""? This is not explicitly stated in the context. However, it can be inferred that the system is likely related to cloud services based on the mentions of ""cloud"" and ""cloud resources"" throughout the text.

To make an educated guess, I would say that this system is probably a ""Public Cloud Service"".. "
