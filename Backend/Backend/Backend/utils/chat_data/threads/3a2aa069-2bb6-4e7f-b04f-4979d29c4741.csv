When new employees are added or when existing employees change roles, the employee\'s role determines which systems they are granted access to and at what access level. Access privileges are reviewed at least yearly and when an employee changes roles or status. Only select and authorized members of the engineering team have access to the production environment where customer data is located. | Category: Access Control', 'text': 'We have a process for managing privileged user access rights, which includes restricting these rights to specific key roles. Privileged user access is closely monitored and reviewed at least quarterly. The findings from these reviews are documented in our access control policy, providing a clear understanding of who has access to what systems and at what level of access. This ensures that sensitive information remains protected and only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions.'}"
